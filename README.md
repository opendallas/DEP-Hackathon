DEP Hackathon
=============

Here are some resources and libraries for the DEP Hackathon. These range from files and APIs listed for you to consume and integrate with your app, or it can be links to resources that can help you start laying down the framework.

Open Mapping Data from Dallas
-----------------------------
We have a couple of resources available from the City of Dallas. Primarily, we have GIS (mapping) data available that can be used in conjunction with Google Maps to map out areas of Dallas, provide information about neighborhoods, etc. 

[GIS Data](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/a9z43isg7gw9jj1/Lbhj91XUJb)

### Possible Ideas To Work With

* Water Usage rates and Storm water repairs.
* GIS shapefiles (council districts, police beats, parks, etc). Create a better interface for geo-referenced data for citizens. This is the current mapping product from the city. [Dallas City Hall Maps](http://maps.dallascityhall.com) 
* Citizen Service Requests from CRMS ß The system may be in the upgrading process now. Currently citizen request information is not available to the public. See Boston's publicy available request data. [Link](https://mayors24.cityofboston.gov:4443/)
* Improved wayfinding within City Hall. (Upload floorplans to [GoogleMaps](http://maps.google.com/help/maps/floorplans/))
* Restaurant Inspection Scores ([Code Compliance](http://www.dallascityhall.com/code_compliance/restaurant_food_scores.html))
* Apartment Inspection Scores ([Code Compliance](http://www.dallascityhall.com/code_compliance/MultitenantScores.html))
* Ordinance and Council minutes/resolutions – a more intuitive UI for navigating minutes, ordinances, etc. (similar to BcWorkshop’s Public Agenda

Running Data through an API
---------------------------
We have a temporary instance of [CKAN](http://ckan.org/) running to supply a live custom API for any given dataset, but only certain types. If you're interested in trying it out, contact [Kyle](http://twitter.com/KyleTaylored) and visit the [instance](http://54.218.95.146).

You can also set up your own JSON API using either [Drupal + Services](https://drupal.org/project/services) or [Wordpress + JSON API](http://wordpress.org/plugins/json-api/) and build your own!

Developer Tools and Resources
-----------------------------
There are many resources you can use to help you develop your app. Though there are a lot, don't get caught up in the vastness! Some of these you won't event need, but just know that they are available to you.
